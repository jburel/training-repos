# Training-Repos
This is a super-module of the repositories used for training sessions:

 - [prod-playbooks](https://github.com/openmicroscopy/prod-playbooks/) contains Ansible playbooks for
   setting up the training server at outreach.openmicroscopy.org
 - [training-scripts](https://github.com/ome/training-scripts/) provides maintenance scripts for
 	managing user accounts and data on the training server as well as scripts for user's workflows in the workshop itself.
 - [training-notebooks](https://github.com/ome/training-notebooks) contains Jupyter notebooks used in the
 	workshops and includes Docker containers for deploying the Jupyter server.

## Data
The freely available files used for workshops can be found in [data.md](data.md).

## Setup
For all repositories, you will want to add an "upstream" remote which contains
the source branch that you are looking to release. Where upstream and
origin are the same, you will likely want both.
